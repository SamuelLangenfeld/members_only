# Members Only!

This app lets members make text posts. Anyone can see the posts, but only members who are signed in can see the authors of each post. The app doesn't allow new users to sign up, so only people who are already part of the club can participate. The app is deployed on [Heroku](https://langenfeld-members-only.herokuapp.com/).

I built this app as an exercise from the [Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication). I have already done previous projects using authentication for apps, but the instructions for this exercise was much more hands off than the previous tutorials I've done and it let really forced me to learn how authentication, routes, controllers, views, and helpers all work together rather than just following outlined steps.
