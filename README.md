# README

This is a Rails project designed to practice using authentication. Authenticated users can make messages and see the authors of any message. Non-authenticated users can only see the messages without knowing who wrote what.  This is an exercise from the [Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication).
